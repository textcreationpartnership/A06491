            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> 
               <pb facs="tcp:9402:4"/> For what ſhould I ſay, vnto who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſhoulde I complayne.

            <p>I muſt recyte a Story. There was ſent hither to Vvittenberch, a certayn doctour out of Fraunce, which ſayde ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly before vs: That hys kyng was ſurely certifyed, that by vs, there was <pb facs="tcp:9402:5"/> no Churche, no Superiorite, no matri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony, but we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one amonge another ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke beaſtes, and that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did what he woulde. Nowe iudge, howe ſhall they in the later daye before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeate of Chriſt loke vpon vs, that haue by their writtinges infourmed the ſaid kyng, &amp; alſo other Countryes ſuche rude and groſſe lyes to be very true? Chriſt the Lorde &amp; iudg of vs all knoweth right well, that they lye, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue lyed, his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt they heare agayne, that am I ſure of, God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te them that are to be conuerted, to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce. To the other it ſhall be ſaid, Vvo and Alaes for euer more.</p>
            <p>And that I retourne agayne to my purpoſe, To ſee a right Counſayll I woulde truely be very glad, where by many matters might be redreſſed, and the people eaſed, Not that we haue nede of it. For oure Churches are nowe trough Goddes grace, with the ſyncere worde, and right vſe of the Sacramentes, with knoweledge of all manner of States, and righte wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, ſo illumined &amp; ſette in order, that <pb facs="tcp:9402:6"/> we for oure parte, care for no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayll, neyther do we loke or hope for any better reformation in theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the Counſayll.</p>
            <p>But there ſee we in the Byſſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rykes euery where, many Paryſſhes voyd and deſolate, which myght cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe a mannes herte to breake. And yet neyther Biſſhops nor Chano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s care ho we the pore people do lyue or dye, for the whiche Chriſte neuertheleſſe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red death, and ſhould not heare the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſpeake with them as the right ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peherde with hys ſhepe. In ſo muche, that I am afrayde, and dredefull, leaſt he let one day an Angelical Counſail paſſe ouer Doucheland, which might vtterlye deſtroye vs all, euen as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorre, ſeyng, we are ſo obſtinate, morkyng, and geſtyng with the Counſayll.</p>
            <p>Beſydes theſe neceſſary Churche matters, are there alſo in the laye ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te innumerable great faultes, whiche had nede of redreſſe.

                  <p>From this Article alſo may no man ſwarne or geue backe. For the fyrſt Article wil not ſuffer it.</p>
                  <p>And yf there were any Papiſtes of deſcretion, any where, men might common with them meaſurably, and reaſone with them after a gentle faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.

And inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man may we lette fall, As Chriſte ſayeth matthei .xv. In vayne do they worſhippe me with preceptes of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondarely is it a thinge not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary, which withoute ſynne or feare may well be lefte.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, maye the Sacrament be had after a godlier and better waye (yea onely after a Godlyer faſſhſon) after Chriſtes inſtitution. Vvhat is it then, that for an inuented and on ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye thinge, which otherwyſe may <pb facs="tcp:9402:10"/> be had well, and muche godlyer, men wyl compelle the worlde to miſerye and neceſſitie?</p>
                  <p>Let it be openly preached vnto the people, howe that the maſſe, as a thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge inuented by man, may withoute ſynne be omitted, and that noman is damned, becauſe he doth not regarde it.

                  <p>But nowe a dayes, dare no Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop preſume to call the Pope Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in thoſe dayes, but muſt call hym his mooſte gratious Lorde, yea though it were a kynge or Emperour. This will, maye or can we not take on oure Conſciences. But they that will, may do it with oute vs.</p>
                  <p>Oute of this followeth. That what <pb facs="tcp:9402:17"/> ſoeuer the pope, by ſuche falſe, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, blaſphemous, vſurped power, hath done and pretended, hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, but a deuelyſſhe acte, and dede, and yet is, (except that, whiche belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral gouernaunce, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rein alſo God permitteth oftentymes much good to be done vnto the people by a tyraunt, and euyll perſon) to the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vniuerſal Catholike church (as much as lyeth in hym) and for to diſtourbe the fyrſt chief Article of the redemption by Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Popyſh bulles and bokes.</note>For there be al hys bulles &amp; bokes, wherein he roareth, lyke a lyon (as the Angel Apocalipſis .xij. doth prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) that no chriſtian can be ſaued, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be obedient &amp; ſubiect vnto hym in al thinges, what ſoeuer he wyl, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and doth, which is none other, but thus much to ſaye. Though thou bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue neuer ſo wel in Chriſt, and haue al thynges in hym, whiche are neceſſary to ſaluation, yet for al that is it all in vayne, yf thou takeſt not me for thy God, and be obedient and ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Notwithſtondynge that it is <pb facs="tcp:9402:17"/> manifeſt that the holy Churche was withoute Pope at the leaſt aboue fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue hundred yeres. And vnto this day the churches of the Grecians, and of many other languages, were neuer vnder the pope, nor be not as yet. So is it then (as often hath ben ſayd) an inuention of man, not commaunded, nedeles, and in vayne, in ſo much that as the holy Catholike churche, maye forbeare ſuche a head wel ynough, &amp; myght haue continued better, yf ſuch a head had not ben reared by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll. And alſo the papacye is not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modious in the churche, for it vſeth no Chriſten office, wherfore the Churche ought to remayne and continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Pope.</p>
                  <p>And I put caſe, that the pope woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de graunte, that he, not Iure diuino, or by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God, were ſuperiour: but to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that thereby the vnitie of the Chriſtianite, againſte ſectes &amp; hereſyes, ſo much the better myght be entertayned, &amp; that therfore muſt be a head, whereby all the reſte myght take hold, and that ſuch a head <pb facs="tcp:9402:18"/> ought to be choſen of men, and ſtode, in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes power and authorite, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me heade, to chaunge, and to degrate as the Counſayll of Conſtaunce kept and vſed euen the ſame trade, with the Popes, for they depoſed thre, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the fourthe. I put caſe now, (I ſaye) that the Pope, and the ſee of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me, woulde graunte and accepte ſuche thinges, which neuertheles is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For he muſt ſuffre his whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, ſtate &amp; gouernaunce to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and chaunged with all his lawes and Bokes, Summa, he kan not do it.</p>
                  <p>Notwitſtondinge all the premiſſes coulde not helpe the Chriſtianite, and there ſhoulde ryſe many more ſectes than before. For ſeynge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſholde not be bounde to obey ſuche a heade by the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, But of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes good will, it ſhoulde very lightely and ſone be deſpiſed, &amp; at the laſt not be eſtemed as a membre. And alſo it muſt not allwayes be at rome or in any other place. But wherſoeuer, and in what Churche, God had geuen ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a man as ſhoulde be mete for the
<pb facs="tcp:9402:18"/> ſame. O what a wylde and diſſolute thinge ſhoulde that be.</p>
                  <p>Therfore can the Churche be neuer better gouerned and mayntayned. Than that we all lyue vnder one hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Chriſte. And that the Byſſhoppes lyke in office (although they be vnlyke in gyftes) earneſtly agree and holde together, in vnitie of doctrine, Faythe, Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, Prayers, and workes of loue. According to the writtinge of S. Ierome. That the Prieſtes of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dria together &amp; in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune did gouerne the Churches, As the Apoſtles did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
